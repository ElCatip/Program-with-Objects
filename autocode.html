         How the Web Works 
    </div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>
         The web is made of connected computers and servers talking to each other (internet infrastructure) using HTML protocol a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. Besides the HTML protocol, there are several layers of protocols, called protocol stack, that serve different functions such as application, transport, network and hardware.

         HTML
    </div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>
         HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see"and markup which describes "how it looks". Standard markup language used to create web pages. It is written in the form of the HTML elements consisting of tags and bracket. HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. Web Browsers can also refer to Cascading Style sheets to define look and layout of text and other material. The Mozilla Developer Network (aka MDN, and a good resource in general), explains key HTML vocabulary.

         Tags and Elements 
    </div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>
         HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.Tags are used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element. A start tag consists of an opening angle bracket followed by the element name, zero or more space separated attribute/value pairs, and a closing angle bracket.

         Inline vs Block Elements 
    </div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>
         HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Block elements are very important in creating web pages because the box is the basic building structure for all web pages. Inline styling is useful for applying a unique style to a single HTML element.

         Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used to describe the look and feel of a document written in a markup language sucha as HTML.It's easy to add style using CSS- Cascading Style Sheets. CSS give programmers a way to control the style of HTML elements. Attributes can be passed or inherited using classes. Usually specified in a different file linked to the HTML file. The separation of format and content makes HTML and CSS a powerful combination of software tools.

         Programming steps for creating a website can be broken down to 3 steps: Code, Test, and Refine.Ideally, think about the size and Look for natural boxes(every web page is made up of boxes). Look for repeated styles and semantics then write your HTML code. Apply styles from biggest to smallest. Fix things until web design looks as intended.

A list can also be part of a list or inside a list. Gets really interesting with nested lists. Lists can be used for different data structures: stack, queues, sets, dictionary.

         Function
    </div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>
         A function is a piece of code used to perform a 
specific task. It requires an input, a process, and an output.
Making a function involves definition and receiving of parameters. 
Programmers can avoid repetition by calling the function for 
repetitive tasks. This eliminates having to write code for each call. Biggest benefit is ability to break down big problems into chunks and code portability. Python like other programming languages have built in functions. See following link for more info on built in functions:  https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html

         Type of programming based on classes and collection of interacting objects. While traditional programming requires use of functions, routines and subroutines, in Object oriented programming each object can receive, process or send messages to other objects. Like a community of objects, each object has a role to play providing a service by performing an action. In large scale programming projects, the ability to hide details(abstraction), encapsulation, inheritance, style, etc. allow a structured method which can be divided into pieces.

Similar to a function but with ability to define new variables, and include additional code. Class is like the mold, blueprint, or template which creates or allows objects to be formed with similar attributes. Different from a module, a class is a user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.

By convention, the first argument of any Python class method (the reference to the current instance) is called self. Destructor --- is the opposite of constructor.
